# AISafetyTemplate

Welcome to the Hackathon repo!
It will serve to coordinate development and organize our findings.

## Goal
To develop a working prototype for standardized software template(s) for AI Safety Evals, Benches and/or Automated Red-Teaming.

## Purpose:
To make post-compute AI safety work more collaborative & standardized.

## Deliverable:
A verifiable software template(s) for post-compute, non-inference-time AI safety work, containerized and ready to be run inside a Trusted Execution Environment.
Something along the lines of:

## Proposed agenda:
- Agree on the technical base (env/langs/tools/etc)
- Gather open-source eval/bench/auto-red-teaming
- Analyze for common properties & abstract/factor them out
- Divide them in to work packages, work in parallel
- Sync, review, refactor
- Integrate in to a unified template
- Cycle back as needed
- Write up Hackathon report
