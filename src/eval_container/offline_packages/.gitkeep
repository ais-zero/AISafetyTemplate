# Offline Python Packages
#
# This directory contains pre-downloaded Python wheel files for air-gapped installation.
#
# To populate this directory:
# 1. Run ./download_offline_packages.sh on a machine with internet access
# 2. Copy the resulting .whl files here
#
# The Dockerfile will use these packages instead of downloading from PyPI.
