## Current OSS AI safety evaluations:
[List & Findings - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P3getD_w-TRob2FjA0o5bj5ZyuHebOrrb-TMMtGBKIc/edit?usp=sharing)
AI use: Assisted by Lumo AI, (please add future uses)

### Analysis (Not complete - Primarily, need to find the broadest subset of eval projects rather than one all-inclusive)
- Most prominently is the use of AI via APIs verses direct model access
- Mostly targets LLM models, as opposed to multiagent frameworks
- Target's various Python versions (≥ 3.8, 3.11/3.12)
- Common util libraries: NumPy, pandas, SciPy
- Docker for containerization
- Most common agent framework: LangChain
